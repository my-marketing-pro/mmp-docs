description: Standard operating procedures, processes, and frameworks for product management at My Marketing Pro
---

Welcome to the **Product Management** documentation for My Marketing Pro. This section contains our standard operating procedures (SOPs), workflows, and best practices for building and shipping features that delight our clients.

## Our Approach

We balance **client satisfaction** with **product vision**, prioritize **speed with quality**, and believe in **transparent communication** throughout the development process. Our goal is to be **proactive** — turning client inputs into structured dev briefs and building scalable processes, not just reacting to requests with quick fixes.

Our product management philosophy:
- **Client-first** (transitioning to product-led)
- **Data-driven prioritization** (RICE scoring + P0-P3 severity framework)
- **Sprint-based development** (2-week sprints with 70/20/10 capacity allocation)
- **Quality releases** (4-stage deployment pipeline with stakeholder validation)
- **Living documentation** (updated as we learn)

3. Learn the [Client Submission Portal](/mmp-docs/product-management/client-submission-portal/) for how feedback flows in
4. Study the [Feature Request Process](/mmp-docs/product-management/feature-request-process/) for triage and prioritization
5. Understand the [Development Workflow](/mmp-docs/product-management/development-workflow/) for sprint-based execution
6. Check the [Release Process](/mmp-docs/product-management/release-process/) and [Deployment Pipeline](/mmp-docs/product-management/testing-deployment-pipeline/) before shipping

**Handling a bug report or feature request?**

3. Ensure every item has clear acceptance criteria
4. Identify on-call developer for the sprint

**Releasing a feature?**
1. Schedule founder review (1:1 demo)
2. QA with team members
3. Stakeholder validation in staging (explicit sign-off for client-facing changes)
4. Deploy during deployment window (Tue-Thu, 10 PM - 2 AM EST)
5. Monitor for 24 hours
