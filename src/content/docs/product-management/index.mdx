description: Standard operating procedures, processes, and frameworks for product management at My Marketing Pro
---

Welcome to the **Product Management** documentation for My Marketing Pro. This section contains our standard operating procedures (SOPs), workflows, and best practices for building and shipping features that delight our clients.

## 🎯 Our Approach

We balance **client satisfaction** with **product vision**, prioritize **speed with quality**, and believe in **transparent communication** throughout the development process.

Our product management philosophy:
- **Client-first** (transitioning to product-led)
- **Data-driven prioritization** (RICE scoring)
- **Quality releases** (3-stage review process)
- **Living documentation** (updated as we learn)
